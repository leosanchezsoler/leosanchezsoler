### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Leonardo, a Data Scientist based in Spain. I love searching for new datasets and watching my initial thoughts demolished when data talks. It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm like one of those (apparently) insignificant rows trying to sketch the big picture.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, ETL processing (advanced knowledge of SQL) , CI/CD pipeline (git branching & orchestration with Kubernetes), and experience with AWS (EC-2). Python and it's libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Pyspark, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, ScikitLearn and Tensorflow...) as well as Business intelligence tools (PowerBi, Tableau...) are under my belt. I've started learning blockchain languages like solidity and Javascript in order to dig into web development. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into my mental dataset.
